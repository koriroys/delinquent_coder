# user stories

As a user
I can signup with github
And I receive a welcome email

As a user
I can authenticate with my github account

As a user not using github
I suck at life and can't signup

As a first time user
After authenticating
I will face a series of coding challenges to see my coding level

As an authenticated user
I see an edit button on every page
When I click the edit button
I can make changes to the page
When I enter a description and click save
The system submits a pull request
And the user sees their changes reflected automatically


# admin stories

As an admin
When I navigate to /admin
And I sign in
I see the admin management page

As an admin
When I am authenticated
When a user submits a change (pull request)
I can accept or reject the request

As an admin
When I am authenticated
I can create new content
